# Machine to Machine Transactions

taken from DXC technology article, ["Machines That Pay Each Other Using Digital Wallets"](https://blogs.dxc.technology/2019/01/29/machines-that-pay-each-other-using-digital-wallets/)

- Machine to Machine (M2M) transactions not suitable under BTC, ETH, or most major blockchains
- Human intervention needed for BTC, other blockchains
- [IOTA]("https"//www.iota.org") solves this problem by integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) system

*idea for M2M*

- Artificial Intelligence "artist" creating paintings, sculputures, etc. 
- Create an NFT with art
- Can process transactions online and deliver NFT, all without human intervention
